## Hello, I'm Joshua

I am a first-year **Information Science** student at **Azim Premji University**.

My ultimate ambition is to become a **Cyber Security Expert**, specifically focusing on **Penetration Testing**. 

This site is being launched as part of my course, **"Becoming A Reflective Information Scientist."** 

> _The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know." — *Albert Einstein_

Welcome to my reflection journey.
